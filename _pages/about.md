Hi! I'm Alexandre Sardinha, a software engineer at [Petrobras](http://www.petrobras.com.br), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I specialize in developing and optimizing geophysics applications, particularly seismic imaging (e.g., RTM), for efficient execution on HPC clusters. My expertise includes parallel programming, GPU computing, performance optimization and computer architecture.

I've received my M.Sc. from [Systems Engineering and Computer Science Program](http://www.cos.ufrj.br) at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and my B.Sc. from [Computer Science Department](http://www.dcc.ufrj.br) also at UFRJ.

In my personal life, I like to play futsal, practice canicross, watch alternative movies, play the drums and travel.
